#Project Title: Advanced Authentication System
Overview
This project demonstrates an advanced authentication system implemented in a web application. The authentication system incorporates several security measures, including JSON Web Tokens (JWT), HTTP-only cookies, and refresh tokens to enhance the overall security of the application.

Features
JWT Authentication: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens for secure and efficient user authentication.

HTTP-only Cookies: Enhances security by storing authentication tokens in HTTP-only cookies, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

Refresh Tokens: Implements refresh tokens to provide a secure mechanism for obtaining new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials.

Technologies Used
Node.js: The server-side runtime environment.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the server.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user information securely.
bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords securely.
jsonwebtoken (JWT): Used to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens.
axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: Used for navigation within the React application.
Material-UI: A React UI framework for creating aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interfaces.


Setup Instructions.
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-authentication-system.git
cd advanced-authentication-system
Install Dependencies:
# Install server-side dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client-side dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the server directory and configure environment variables such as database connection URI, JWT secret key, etc.
Run the Application:
# Start the server
cd server
npm start

# Start the client
cd ../client
npm start
The application should now be running locally. Access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

#Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories:

server: Contains the server-side code, including authentication routes, middleware, and database models.
client: Contains the client-side code, including React components, pages, and the application's user interface.
